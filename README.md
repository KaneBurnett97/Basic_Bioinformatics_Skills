Basic Bioinformatics skills portfolio

The intention of this respository is to showcase my basic coding abilities in relation to basic problems/queries of biological data. This includes:

Converting DNA to RNA and protein sequences and finding the reverse complement of such nucleotide sequences
Calculating the frequency of bases/amino-acids in a nucleotide/protein sequence
Finding open reading frames (ORFs) and calculating the possible proteins that can be created from each ORF
Using biological database tools such as 'BLAST'

For each basic 'problem' I have created both a python script and an R script (the later being the language I am more comfortable/familiar with).
